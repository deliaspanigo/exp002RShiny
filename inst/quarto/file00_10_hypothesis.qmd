This section details the statistical hypotheses for the tests used to validate the assumptions and primary conclusion of the One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

## One-Way ANOVA Hypotheses

The one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test determines if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.

| Hypothesis Type | Notation | English Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Null Hypothesis** | $H_0$ | The means of all population groups are equal. |
| **Alternative Hypothesis** | $H_a$ | At least one group mean is different from the others. |

**Null Hypothesis Equation:** $$\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots = \mu_k$$

## Shapiro-Wilk Test (Residual Normality)

The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to check if the sample data (the **ANOVA residuals**) follows a normal distribution, which is a required assumption for the ANOVA test.

| Hypothesis Type | Notation | English Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Null Hypothesis** | $H_0$ | The data (residuals) are drawn from a normally distributed population. |
| **Alternative Hypothesis** | $H_a$ | The data (residuals) are **not** drawn from a normally distributed population. |

## Levene's Test (Homogeneity of Variances)

Levene's test is used to verify the assumption of **homoscedasticity** (\(\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 = \dots = \sigma^2_k\)) across the different groups being compared in the ANOVA.

| Hypothesis Type | Notation | English Statement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Null Hypothesis** | $H_0$ | The population variances of the groups are equal. |
| **Alternative Hypothesis** | $H_a$ | The population variances of the groups are **not** equal. |
